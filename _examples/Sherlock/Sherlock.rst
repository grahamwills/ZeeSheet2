↺ -- **Suspect of Opportunity (1/hour)**
 - **Trigger**: *A foe takes a hostile action against you in combat.* -- *Once per hour*
 - Sometimes something intrudes upon your case unexpectedly, such as an ambush sent to bring your investigation to a close. You’ve learned how to compartmentalize your main lead and pursue a new one for your current predicament. You Pursue a Lead against the triggering foe, setting aside but not ending one of your currently active leads, if you have two leads. At the end of the combat encounter, you stop Pursuing the Lead against the triggering foe and return to the original lead, if you have one.

.. block:: style=back_green

↺ -- **Clue In (1/10 minutes)**
 - **Trigger**: *Another creature attempts a check to investigate a lead you’re pursuing.* -- *Once per 10 minutes*
 - You share information with the triggering creature. They gain a circumstance bonus to their check equal to your circumstance bonus to checks investigating your subject from Pursue a Lead. The GM can add any relevant traits to this reaction depending on the situation, such as auditory and linguistic if you’re conveying information verbally.

.. title:: banner style=banner_green
.. block:: style=back_green

▶ -- **Devise a Stratagem (1/round)**
 -  -- *Once per round*
 - You assess a foe’s weaknesses in combat and use them to formulate a plan of attack against your enemy. Choose a creature you can see and roll a d20. If you Strike the chosen creature later this round, you must use the result of the roll you made to Devise a Stratagem for your Strike’s attack roll instead of rolling. You make this substitution only for the first Strike you make against the creature this round, not any subsequent attacks.
 - When you make this substitution, you can also add your Intelligence modifier to your attack roll instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, provided your Strike uses an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon (which must be agile or finesse if it’s a melee weapon with the thrown trait), or a sap.
 - If you’re aware that the creature you choose is the subject of a lead you’re pursuing, you can use this ability as a free action.

.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶ -- **Pass Without Trace (forest only, Constant)** -- *1*
 - **Duration**: 1 hour
 - You obscure the tracks you leave behind and make it harder for others to find you. The DC of checks to Track you gains a +4 status bonus or is equal to your spell DC, whichever results in a higher DC. You can benefit from only one pass without trace spell at a time.
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Abjuration</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶▶ -- **Summon Elemental (1/day)** -- *2→4*
 - **Range**: 30 feet 
 - **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute
 - You conjure an elemental to fight for you. This works like summon animal, except you summon a common creature that has the elemental trait and whose level is 1 or lower.
 - **Heightened (3Rd) Level 2.**
 - **Heightened (4th)**: Level 3.
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Conjuration</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_orange
.. block:: style=back_orange

▶▶▶ -- **Hat of the magi, greater**
 - This hat comes in many forms, such as a colorful turban or a pointy hat with a brim, and can bear symbols or runes. It grants you a +1 item bonus to Arcana checks and allows you to cast the prestidigitation cantrip as an arcane innate spell.
 - **Greater**
 - This larger, fancier hat grants a +2 bonus and can be activated.
 - **Activate**: ▶▶▶ Cast a Spell; Frequency once per day
 - **Effect**: You cast a 4th-level arcane summon elemental spell.

.. title:: banner style=banner_orange
.. block:: style=back_orange

▶ -- **Bag of holding II**
 - Though it appears to be a cloth sack decorated with panels of richly colored silk or stylish embroidery, a bag of holding opens into an extradimensional space larger than its outside dimensions. The Bulk held inside the bag doesn’t change the Bulk of the bag of holding itself. The amount of Bulk the bag’s extradimensional space can hold depends on its type.
 - You can Interact with the bag of holding to put items in or remove them just like a mundane sack. Though the bag can hold a great amount of material, an object still needs to be able to fit through the opening of the sack to be stored inside.
 - **Type Ii**

.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶ -- **Hypercognition (1/hour)** -- *3*
 - You rapidly catalog and collate information relevant to your current situation. You can instantly use up to 6 Recall Knowledge actions as part of Casting this Spell. For these actions, you can’t use any special abilities, reactions, or free actions that trigger when you Recall Knowledge.
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Divination</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_orange
.. block:: style=back_orange

▶ -- **Diadem of intellect**
 - An elegant, colorful gem cut into a complex geometric pattern is slotted into a narrow metal band that fits around your brow. You gain a +3 item bonus to checks to Recall Knowledge, regardless of the skill. When you invest the diadem, you either increase your Intelligence score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score. This gives you additional trained skills and languages, as normal for increasing your Intelligence score. You must select skills and languages the first time you invest the item, and whenever you invest the same diadem of intellect, you get the same skills and languages you chose the first time.
 - **Activate**: ▶ envision; Frequency once per hour
 - **Effect**: You gain the effects of hypercognition

.. block:: style=back_red

▶ -- **Guidance (At Will)** -- *1→9*
 - **Target**: 1 creature within 30 feet 
 - **Duration**: until the start of your next turn
 - You ask for divine guidance, granting the target a +1 status bonus to one attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check the target attempts before the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before rolling. If the target uses the bonus, the spell ends. Either way, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Divination • Cantrip</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶ -- **Telekinetic Projectile (At Will)** -- *1→9*
 - **Target**: 1 creature within 30 feet 
 - You hurl a loose, unattended object that is within range and that has 1 Bulk or less at the target. Make a spell attack roll against the target. If you hit, you deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage—as appropriate for the object you hurled—equal to 1d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. No specific traits or magic properties of the hurled item affect the attack or the damage.
 - **Heightened (+1)**: The damage increases by 1d6.
 - **Critical Success**: You deal double damage.
 - **Success**: You deal full damage.
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Evocation • Arcane • Attack • Cantrip</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶ -- **Shocking Grasp** -- *1*
 - **Target**: 1 creature within touch 
 - You shroud your hands in a crackling field of lightning. Make a melee spell attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 2d12 electricity damage. If the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll with shocking grasp, and the target also takes 1d4 persistent electricity damage on a hit. On a critical hit, double the initial damage, but not the persistent damage.
 - **Heightened (+1)**: The damage increases by 1d12, and the persistent electricity damage increases by 1.

.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶▶ -- **Wall of Force** -- *6*
 - **Range**: 30 feet 
 - **Duration**: 1 minute
 - You form an invisible wall of pure magical force up to 50 feet long and up to 20 feet high. The wall has no discernible thickness. You must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. The wall has AC 10, Hardness 30, and 60 Hit Points, and it’s immune to critical hits and precision damage. The wall blocks physical effects from passing through it, and because it’s made of force, it blocks incorporeal and ethereal creatures as well. Teleportation effects can pass through the barrier, as can visual effects (since the wall is invisible).
 - Wall of force is immune to counteracting effects of its level or lower, but the wall is automatically destroyed by a disintegrate spell of any level or by contact with a rod of cancellation or sphere of annihilation.
 - **Heightened (+2)**: The Hit Points of the wall increases by 20.
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Evocation • Arcane • Force</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶ -- **Searing Light (1/day)** -- *3→9*
 - **Target**: 1 creature within 120 feet 
 - You shoot a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 fire damage. If the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra 5d6 good damage.
 - If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, searing light attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell’s target
 - **Heightened (+1)**: The fire damage increases by 2d6, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by 2d6.
 - **Critical Success**: The target takes double fire damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.
 - **Success**: The target takes full damage.

▶▶ -- **Prestidigitation (At Will)** -- *1→9*
 - **Target**: 1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only) within 10 feet 
 - **Duration**: sustained
 - The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple magical effects for as long as you Sustain the Spell. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can choose one of four options.
 - `• Cook Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.`
 - `• Lift Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot offthe ground.`
 - `• Make Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile—it can’t be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.`
 - `• Tidy Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk.`
 - Prestidigitation can’t deal damage or cause adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond what is noted above) persists only as long as you Sustain the Spell.
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Evocation • Cantrip</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶ -- **Invisibility (2/day)** -- *2→4*
 - **Target**: one creature within touch 
 - **Duration**: 10 minute
 - Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes invisible. This makes it undetected to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it hidden to them instead (page 466). If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends after that hostile action is completed.
 - **Heightened (4th)**: The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn’t end if the target uses a hostile action.
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Illusion</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶ -- **Invisibility Sphere** -- *3*
 - **Target**: you and any number of creatures  in 10-foot aura 
 - **Duration**: 10 minutes
 - You and all targets are invisible except to each other as long as you remain within the spell’s area. If a creature made invisible by this spell leaves the spell’s area, it becomes visible and remains so even if it returns to the spell’s area. If any creature made invisible by this spell uses a hostile action, the spell ends after the hostile action is completed.
 - While exploring, it’s easy to move together slowly and remain invisible. This is untenable in a battle, however. Once an encounter begins, creatures remain invisible until at most the end of the  rst round, at which point the spell ends.
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Illusion • Arcane</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶ -- **Blur** -- *2*
 - **Target**: 1 creature within touch 
 - **Duration**: 1 minute
 - The target’s form appears blurry. It becomes concealed. As the nature of this effect still leaves the target’s location obvious, the target can’t use this concealment to Hide or Sneak.
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Illusion • Arcane • Visual</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶ -- **Ghost Sound (At Will)** -- *1→9*
 - **Range**: 30 feet 
 - **Duration**: sustained
 - You create an auditory illusion of simple sounds that has a maximum volume equal to four normal humans shouting. The sounds emanate from a square you designate within range. You can’t create intelligible words or other intricate sounds (such as music).
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Illusion • Auditory • Cantrip</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_orange

↺ -- **Snapleaf**
 - **Trigger**: *You begin to fall* -- 
 - This small, crystalline carving takes the shape of a tree leaf and attaches to armor or clothing with a simple strap. When you activate the snapleaf, you gain the benefits of feather fall and a 2nd-level invisibility spell for 1 minute or until you stop falling, whichever comes first.

.. title:: banner style=banner_orange
.. block:: style=back_orange

▶▶ -- **Cloak of elvenkind, greater**
 - This cloak is deep green with a voluminous hood, embroidered with gold trim and symbols significant in elven culture. The cloak allows you to cast the ghost sound cantrip as an arcane innate spell. When you adjust the cloak’s clasp (an Interact action), the cloak transforms to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, granting you a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks.
 - **Activate**: ▶▶ Interact; Frequency once per day
 - **Effect**: You draw the hood up and gain the effects of invisibility, with the spell’s normal duration or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first. If you’re also wearing boots of elvenkind, you can activate this ability twice per day.
 - **Greater**
 - The cloak grants a +2 item bonus, and the effects of 4th-level invisibility. If you’re also wearing boots of elvenkind, the greater cloak of elvenkind allows you to Sneak in forest environments even when creatures are currently observing you.

.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶ -- **Blood Feast** -- *5*
 - **Target**: 1 creature within touch 
 - Your head splits vertically into an enormous maw, which feasts upon the target's blood, dealing 12d6 piercing damage, depending on your spell attack roll. After the spell, your head sews back together as if it had never split apart. You gain temporary Hit Points for 1 minute equal to half the piercing damage the target takes. If you are a gug, increase the piercing damage by 2d6 and increase the persistent bleed damage you deal on a critical hit by 1d8. This spell doesn’t alter a gug’s appearance.
 - **Heightened (+1)**: The piercing damage increases by 2d6, and the persistent bleed damage on a critical increases by 1.
 - **Critical Success**: The creature takes double damage and 1d8 persistent bleed damage.
 - **Success**: The creature takes full damage.

▶▶▶ -- **Arrow of Death (1/day, DC 38)**
 -  -- *Once per day*
 - You modify an arrow or bolt to bring death to your target in a single potent hit. Make a bow Strike. On a hit, you deal an additional 10d10 precision damage. On a critical hit, the target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be immediately slain; this save has the death and incapacitation traits.

 - **Activate**: ▶ Interact; Frequency once per day
 - **Effect**: You can soothe a willing, adjacent creature’s wounds, restoring 2d6+7 Hit Points to that creature. This is a positive healing effect. You can’t harm undead with this healing.

.. title:: banner style=banner_orange

▶ -- **Marvelous medicines, greater**
 - This set of healer’s tools contains a seemingly endless supply of bandages, herbs, and healing items of impeccable quality, granting you a +2 item bonus to Medicine checks.
 - **Activate**: ▶ Treat Poison or 8 hours (Treat Disease)

Once these medicines have been used to treat a patient’s poison or disease, they can’t be used again to treat the same affliction for that patient.
 - **Type Greater**
 - The tools grant a +3 item bonus, and the spells are heightened to 6th level.

.. title:: banner style=banner_black

▶ -- **Trick Magic Item**
 - You examine a magic item you normally couldn’t use in an effort to fool it and activate it temporarily. For example, this might allow a fighter to cast a spell from a wand or allow a wizard to cast a spell that’s not on the arcane list using a scroll. You must know what activating the item does, or you can’t attempt to trick it.

↺ -- **Unexpected Shift**
 - **Trigger**: *You would take damage from an attack, spell, or other effect.* --

 - You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell do not occur immediately but are imbued into the bow you’re wielding. Make a Strike with that bow. Your spell flies with the ammunition, using your attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but you don’t apply the penalty until after you’ve completed both attacks.
