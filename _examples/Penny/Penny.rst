▶ -- **Shooting Star** -- *1*
 - You let loose a projectile that flies true and leaves the blazing trail of a meteor behind it. Make a ranged Strike, ignoring the target’s concealment and reducing the target’s cover by one degree for this Strike only (greater to standard, standard to lesser, and lesser to none). If the Strike hits, the meteor trail hangs in the air. This gives the benefits of concealment negation and cover reduction to any attacks made against the creature (by anyone) until the start of your next turn.

.. title:: banner style=banner_green
.. block:: style=back_green

▶ -- **Arcane Cascade +1**
 - You divert a portion of the spell’s magical power and keep it cycling through your body and weapon using specialized forms, breathing, or footwork. While you’re in the stance, your melee Strikes deal 1 extra damage. This damage increases to 2 if you have weapon specialization and 3 if you have greater weapon specialization. Any Strike that benefits from this damage gains the arcane trait, making it magical. If your most recent spell before entering the stance was one that can deal damage, the damage from the stance is the same type that spell could deal (or one type of your choice if the spell could deal multiple types of damage). If the spell couldn’t deal damage, this stance’s bonus damage depends on the spell’s school.
 - `• Abjuration or Evocation force`
 - `• Conjuration or Transmutation same type as your weapon or unarmed attack`
 - `• Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion mental`
 - `• Necromancy negative`

▶ -- **Shield (At Will)** -- *1*
 - **Duration**: until the start of your next turn
 - You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as using the Raise a Shield action, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, but it doesn’t require a hand to use.
 - While the spell is in effect, you can use the Shield Block reaction with your magic shield (see below). The shield has Hardness 5. After you use Shield Block, the spell ends and you can’t cast it again for 10 minutes. Unlike a normal Shield Block, you can use the spell’s reaction against the magic missile spell.
 - Heightening the spell increases the shield’s Hardness.
 - **Shield Actions**
 - The shield spell works like a raised shield, and it also gives you the ability to use the Shield Block reaction.
 - **Shield Block ↺**
 - Trigger While you have your shield raised, you take damage from a physical attack.

▶▶ -- **Infectious Enthusiasm (At Will)** -- *1*
 - **Duration**: 1 round
 - With enchanted gusto, you encourage yourself to get things done and share your motivation with your allies. You gain a +1 status bonus to your choice of attack rolls, Will saves, or Charisma-based skill checks. During the spell’s duration, an ally who observed you Casting this Spell and was within 30 feet when you did so can take a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to gain the same bonus you chose until the start of its next turn.
 - Using this spell to influence someone in a social situation is typically considered a faux pas, negating the benefit on Charisma-based skills if the subject of the check observed you casting the spell.

.. title:: banner style=banner_red

▶▶ -- **Acid Splash (At Will)** -- *1*
 - **Target**: one creature or object within 30 feet 
 - You splash a glob of acid that splatters creatures and objects alike. Make a spell attack. If you hit, you deal 1d6 acid damage plus 1 splash acid damage. On a critical success, the target also takes 1 persistent acid damage.

.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶ -- **Gust of Wind** -- *1*
 - **Area**: 60-foot line 
 - **Duration**: until the start of your next turn
 - A violent wind issues forth from your palm, blowing from the point where you are when you cast the spell to the line’s opposite end. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows objects of light Bulk or less around, and pushes larger objects. Large or smaller creatures in the area must attempt a Fortitude save. Large or smaller creatures that later move into the gust must attempt the save on entering.
 - **Critical Success**: The creature is unaffected.
 - **Success**: The creature can’t move against the wind.
 - **Failure**: The creature is knocked prone. If it was flying, it suffers the effects of critical failure instead.
 - **Critical Failure**: The creature is pushed 30 feet in the wind’s direction, knocked prone, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

.. title:: banner style=banner_red

▶▶ -- **Telekinetic Projectile (At Will)** -- *1*
 - **Target**: 1 creature within 30 feet 
 - You hurl a loose, unattended object that is within range and that has 1 Bulk or less at the target. Make a spell attack roll against the target. If you hit, you deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage—as appropriate for the object you hurled—equal to 1d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. No specific traits or magic properties of the hurled item affect the attack or the damage.
 - **Heightened (+1)**: The damage increases by 1d6.
 - **Critical Success**: You deal double damage.
 - **Success**: You deal full damage.
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Evocation • Arcane • Attack • Cantrip</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_red
.. block:: style=back_red

▶▶ -- **Produce Flame (At Will)** -- *1*
 - **Target**: 1 creature within 30 feet 
 - A small ball of flame appears in the palm of your hand, and you lash out with it either in melee or at range. Make a spell attack roll against your target’s AC. This is normally a ranged attack, but you can also make a melee attack against a creature in your unarmed reach. On a success, you deal 1d4 fire damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and 1d4 persistent fire damage.
 - **Heightened (+1)**: Increase the damage by 1d4 and the persistent damage on a critical hit by 1d4.
 - -- <font size=6 color='gray'>Evocation • Arcane • Attack • Cantrip • Fire</font> -- 


.. title:: banner style=banner_black
.. block:: style=back_black

▶ -- **Trick Magic Item**
 - You examine a magic item you normally couldn’t use in an effort to fool it and activate it temporarily. For example, this might allow a fighter to cast a spell from a wand or allow a wizard to cast a spell that’s not on the arcane list using a scroll. You must know what activating the item does, or you can’t attempt to trick it.
 - **Success**: For the rest of the current turn, you can spend actions to activate the item as if you could normally use it.
 - **Failure**: You can’t use the item or try to trick it again this turn, but you can try again on subsequent turns.
 - **Critical Failure**: You can’t use the item, and you can’t try to trick it again until your next daily preparations.

▶▶ -- **Spellstrike**
 -  -- *Until recharged*
 - You’ve learned the fundamental magus technique that lets you combine magical and physical attacks together. You gain the Spellstrike activity.
 - You channel a spell into a punch or sword thrust to deliver a combined attack. You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don’t occur immediately but are imbued into your attack instead. Make a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack. Your spell is coupled with your attack, using your attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but you don’t apply the penalty until after you’ve completed the Spellstrike. The infusion of spell energy grants your Strike the arcane trait, making it magical.
