            <h1>Document structure</h1>
            <p>A character sheet document has the following structure, working from the top down:</p>
            <dl class="docutils">
                <dt>Sheet</dt>
                <dd>This is the whole document. It comprises one or more sections.
                    The sheet has the same layout options as a section does, but typically the simple
                    layout of of stacking sections below each other works well
                </dd>
                <dt>Section</dt>
                <dd>A section is a rectangular area comprised of a set of blocks.
                    Each section has a defined layout and places the blocks inside that layout.
                    Sections usually have titles which can be displayed or hidden.
                    A simple sheet may only have a single section.
                </dd>
                <dt>Block</dt>
                <dd>The block is the fundamental layout unit. It is rectangular area and contains a
                    number of items that are laid out inside it. It has a title which may be displayed or hidden.
                    Blocks have differemt layout options, sometimes very specific to the content,
                    but the table layout is the most common (nd the default).
                    All items in a block share the same basic presentation style
                </dd>
                <dt>Item</dt>
                <dd>Blocks are divided into items, each of which displays as a coherent whole.
                    In a 'table' block, an item corresponds to a row of the table.
                    In an 'attributes' block, an item corresponds to a single attribute.
                    Items usually have multiple parts, each of which is a combination of
                    piece of text, editable fields, or checkboxes.

                <p>Titles and content items in a block can contain multiple parts, separated by a '|' symbol
                    (often called a <em>pipe symbol</em>). When the block method is <cite>table</cite> -- the default --
                    then the pipe symbol
                    divides up a row into columns; the first part is the in the first column, the second in the second,
                    etc. Some
                    notes for tables:</p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>The number of columns in a table is equal to the number of columns in the row with the most
                        columns
                    </li>
                    <li>The last part in a row fills all the remaining columns to the right of the table.</li>
                    <li>By default, the right column is right aligned.</li>
                    <li>If there are more than two columns, the central columns are center aligned</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When the block method is <cite>attributes</cite>, then each itme is expected to have two or three
                    parts.
                    The first is the name of an attribute, the second its value and the third is a optional 'other
                    value'.
                    These are drawn in a specific block layout for that attribute</p>

                <p>An item is defined using a list item prefix, a dash or a bullet.
                    If an item text is long, then when you wrap it, make sure you indent subsequent lines to keep them
                    part
                    of the same item. You do not need to put blank lines between list items.</p>

            <h1>Styles</h1>
            <p>Styles are designed to be similar to the way they are used in HTML.
                They provide a list of options that control the appearance of the content.
                Sheets, sections, blocks and block titles each have their own style with a default that can be overriden
                by definign a <strong>styles</strong> section, usually placed at the bottom of your sheet. An example
                style section looks
                like this:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
.. styles::
   default
     text-opacity:0.8 font-family:Montserrat font-size:8 font-spacing:90%
   attr
     text-color:white text-align:center font-size:14 border:black border-width:0.5 background:brown
     padding:4
   default-block
     border:none
</pre>
            <p>After the <cite>.. styles:</cite> directive, styls are defined by a name ona sinlge line, followed by a
                list of
                properties on indented lines following.</p>
            <p>In the above example, the default font <strong>default</strong> has been overriden. Since all styles are
                based on this
                style to some extent, those definitions will affect pretty much everything. The default definition for
                the block
                has also been changed so that blcoks no longer have borders by default.</p>
            <p>The style <strong>attr</strong> is not a default style however, so setting values for it will only change
                the appearance of
                parts of the sheet that specifically reference this style.</p>
            <div class="section" id="style-inheritance">
                <h2>Style Inheritance</h2>
                <p>All styles (except <em>default</em>) inherit from another style, and if values of the base style are
                    not defined,
                    then the values of the style's parent are used. When you define your own style, it is automatcially
                    given a
                    parent to inherit from if you do not define one explicitly. Usually, that should be a good enough
                    choice for
                    you. The choice of what to inherit from is done semi-intelligently; if a style is mostly used for
                    attributes,
                    for example, it will inherit from <em>default-attributes</em>.</p>

                        a color that will match well with other defined colors for the style. It even considers the
                        colors in
                        other styles in the same block. This allows you to define a background color, for example, and
                        have the
                        text color automatically chosen to contrast well with it.

                        right aligned. 'same' alignment (for <em>text-align-last</em>) sattes that the alignment of the
                        last
                        line in some wrapping text is aligned the same was as the previous lines. Standard alignments
                        are left,
                        right and center.
