        <p>
            To register as a user for this site, you only need to enter a username and
            a password. We do recommend adding an email as that is used if you need to reset
            your password without needing to contact an admin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your first and last names are entirely optional and are not used at the moment.

        <p class="text-danger">
            This site should not be considered as highly secure. Do not use any password that you
            use for anything important. The password requirements have been loosened so that you can
            use short and common passwords. It's up to you how much you care!
